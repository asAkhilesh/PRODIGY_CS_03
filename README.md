## Overview
The Network Packet Analyzer is a GUI-based tool that captures and analyzes network traffic in real time. Built using Python, Scapy, and Tkinter, it allows users to filter packets by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP) and includes a basic intrusion detection system for detecting suspicious activity.

With a modern UI, real-time packet logging, and filtering capabilities, this tool is ideal for network monitoring, security analysis, and educational purposes
